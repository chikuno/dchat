## Known Limitations

1. **Storage**
   - SQLite for local storage (not distributed)
   - Manual backup required (should be automated in ops)
   - Max message size: 100MB

2. **Network**
   - Requires manual port forwarding for full P2P
   - UPnP may not work behind strict firewalls
   - DNS depends on external services

3. **Scalability**
   - Single-threaded database access (SQLite)
   - In-memory relay state (restarts lose it)
   - Recommend state channels for high throughput

4. **Operations**
   - Manual schema migrations (should be automated)
   - No built-in metrics collection (should add prometheus)
   - Alert system framework only (need actual implementation)

### Mitigation Strategies
- Upgrade to PostgreSQL for horizontal scaling
- Implement distributed consensus for relay state
- Auto-migrate database schema on startup
- Add prometheus metrics collection in Phase 7
- Implement PagerDuty/Alertmanager integration
