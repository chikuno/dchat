3. **Formal Verification (Section 32)** - TLA+ specs, Coq proofs, continuous fuzzing

### Production Readiness Tasks:
1. Performance optimization (profiling, benchmarks)
2. Security audit (crypto review, penetration testing)
3. User acceptance testing (UX feedback, accessibility testing)
4. Documentation (API docs, architecture diagrams, runbooks)
5. Deployment infrastructure (Docker, Kubernetes, monitoring)

### Phase 6 Planning:
- **Focus**: Production hardening, security audits, performance optimization
- **Goals**:
