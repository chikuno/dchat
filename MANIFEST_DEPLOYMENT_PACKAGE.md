## 🔒 Security Includes

### Built-In Security
```
✅ Health checks (prevent failed services)
✅ Resource limits (prevent resource exhaustion)
✅ Network isolation (prevent cross-service interference)
✅ Volume permissions (prevent unauthorized access)
✅ Log rotation (prevent disk fill)
✅ Container non-root (principle of least privilege)
✅ Environment isolation (secrets not in code)
```

### Recommended Post-Deployment
```
⚠️  Change Grafana admin password
⚠️  Enable UFW firewall
⚠️  Configure fail2ban
⚠️  Setup SSL/TLS certificates
⚠️  Enable audit logging
⚠️  Setup automated backups
⚠️  Configure alerting
⚠️  Document recovery procedures
```
