# Phase 5 Advanced Features Roadmap

**Version**: 1.0  
**Status**: Design Phase (Implementation in Phase 6)  
**Priority**: High for production deployment

---

## Overview

This document outlines advanced features recommended for Phase 6 to enhance Phase 5 components toward enterprise production readiness.

---

## 1. Advanced Marketplace Features

### 1.1 Escrow System

**Current State**: Direct payment transfer  
**Issue**: Buyer pays, seller can refuse to deliver (or vice versa)  
**Solution**: Escrow middleware holds funds pending delivery

#### Design

```rust
pub struct EscrowAccount {
    pub account_id: String,
    pub buyer_id: UserId,
    pub seller_id: UserId,
    pub amount: u64,
    pub status: EscrowStatus,
    pub created_at: DateTime<Utc>,
    pub expires_at: DateTime<Utc>,
}

pub enum EscrowStatus {
    Locked,           // Funds locked, awaiting delivery
    Released,         // Delivery confirmed, funds released to seller
    Refunded,         // Transaction cancelled, funds returned to buyer
    Disputed,         // In dispute resolution
}
```

#### Workflow

```
1. Buyer initiates purchase with escrow
   - Funds transferred to escrow account (temporary hold)
   - NFT/good listed as pending delivery
   
2. Seller confirms delivery
   - Escrow releases funds to seller
   - Buyer receives NFT/good
   
3. If dispute:
   - Either party can escalate
   - DAO voting on resolution (see Â§1.2)
   - Refund or release based on vote
```

#### Implementation Priority: ðŸ”´ HIGH
- Required for marketplace trust
- Prevents fraud/non-delivery
- Should be implemented before public launch

---

### 1.2 Dispute Resolution via DAO Voting

**Current State**: No dispute mechanism  
**Issue**: Stuck escrows if buyer/seller disagree  
**Solution**: DAO votes on contested transactions

#### Design

```rust
pub struct MarketplaceDispute {
    pub dispute_id: String,
    pub escrow_id: String,
    pub initiator: UserId,
    pub reason: DisputeReason,
    pub evidence: Vec<String>,  // IPFS hashes
    pub vote_period: Duration,
    pub resolution: Option<DisputeResolution>,
}

pub enum DisputeReason {
    NonDelivery,          // Seller didn't deliver
    WrongItem,            // Item doesn't match description
    QualityIssue,         // Item damaged/defective
    UnauthorizedCharge,   // Buyer disputes payment
}

pub enum DisputeResolution {
    RefundBuyer,
    ReleaseSeller,
    PartialRefund(u64),  // Split escrow
}
```

#### Workflow

```
1. Dispute filed
   - Either party can initiate
   - Escrow moves to "Disputed" status
   
2. Evidence submission (24 hours)
   - Both parties submit evidence (IPFS links)
   - Evidence immutably recorded
   
3. DAO voting (7 days)
   - Token holders vote
   - â‰¥50% required to resolve
   - 1 token = 1 vote
   
4. Resolution executed
   - Funds moved per vote outcome
   - Results public and immutable
```

#### Implementation Priority: ðŸŸ¡ MEDIUM
- Critical for marketplace trust
- Requires DAO integration (already in Phase 4)
- Can launch with manual review initially

---

### 1.3 Royalty Splitting

**Current State**: 100% revenue to creator  
**Issue**: Co-creators, artists, collabs not supported  
**Solution**: Automatic royalty distribution

#### Design

```rust
pub struct Royalty {
    pub recipient_id: UserId,
    pub percentage: u8,  // 0-100
    pub verified: bool,  // Both parties confirm
}

pub struct ListingWithRoyalties {
    pub listing: DigitalGoodListing,
    pub royalties: Vec<Royalty>,  // Must sum to â‰¤100%
}

pub struct RoyaltyPayment {
    pub transaction_id: String,
    pub distributions: Vec<(UserId, u64)>,  // (recipient, amount)
    pub timestamp: DateTime<Utc>,
}
```

#### Workflow

```
1. Creator lists with co-creators
   - Specifies split (e.g., 60% artist, 40% platform curator)
   - All parties must verify
   
2. Purchase occurs
   - Escrow holds full amount
   
3. Delivery confirmed
   - Automatic royalty distribution
   - Each recipient receives their share
   - All distributions on-chain for transparency
```

#### Implementation Priority: ðŸŸ¢ LOW
- Nice-to-have for Phase 5
- Phase 6+ feature
- Requires on-chain royalty registry

---

## 2. Advanced Bridge Features

### 2.1 Multi-Signature Validator Scheme

**Current State**: Single validator per signature  
**Issue**: Single point of failure, validator collusion  
**Solution**: M-of-N multi-signature threshold

#### Design

```rust
pub struct MultiSigValidator {
    pub validators: Vec<ValidatorKey>,
    pub threshold: usize,  // M of N
    pub name: String,
}

pub struct FinalityProofMultiSig {
    pub transaction_id: String,
    pub multi_sig_validator_id: String,
    pub signatures: Vec<ValidatorSignature>,
    pub aggregated_signature: Option<BlsAggregatedSignature>,  // BLS aggregation
    pub timestamp: DateTime<Utc>,
}

pub struct ValidatorSignature {
    pub validator_id: String,
    pub signature: Vec<u8>,
    pub timestamp: DateTime<Utc>,
}
```

#### Workflow

```
1. Transaction initiated
   - Routed to assigned validator set (3-of-5 for example)
   
2. Validators sign proof
   - Each validator independently verifies
   - Signs with private key
   - No coordination needed (async)
   
3. Aggregate signatures (optional BLS)
   - Combine multiple signatures into one
   - Reduces message size
   - Verifiable as single signature
   
4. Submit aggregated proof
   - 3 signatures already collected
   - Single verification instead of 3
   - 10x faster on-chain verification
```

#### Implementation Priority: ðŸ”´ HIGH
- Critical for validator decentralization
- Improves finality latency 10x with BLS
- Must implement before mainnet

---

### 2.2 Timelocked Rollback

**Current State**: Immediate rollback option  
**Issue**: Rollback too easy, disputes about finality  
**Solution**: Timelock prevents premature rollback

#### Design

```rust
pub struct TimelockedRollback {
    pub transaction_id: String,
    pub requested_at: DateTime<Utc>,
    pub earliest_execution: DateTime<Utc>,  // Now + 48 hours
    pub reason: String,
    pub status: RollbackStatus,
}

pub enum RollbackStatus {
    Pending,        // Waiting for timelock
    Contested,      // Other party filed objection
    Approved,       // Can execute
    Executed,       // Rollback completed
    Cancelled,      // Timelock overridden (requires DAO vote)
}
```

#### Workflow

```
1. Rollback requested
   - Transaction marked for rollback
   - 48-hour timelock begins
   - Both parties notified
   
2. Contest period (48 hours)
   - Other party can contest
   - If contested â†’ DAO vote required
   - Otherwise â†’ auto-execute after 48h
   
3. Execution or override
   - 48h passed and no contest â†’ auto-rollback
   - Contested â†’ vote determines outcome
   - Can be cancelled by DAO if invalid
```

#### Implementation Priority: ðŸŸ¡ MEDIUM
- Adds confidence to finality
- Requires timelock timer implementation
- Phase 6+ feature

---

### 2.3 State Reconciliation Snapshots

**Current State**: Transaction-level consistency  
**Issue**: Long-term state drift possible  
**Solution**: Periodic full state snapshots

#### Design

```rust
pub struct StateSnapshot {
    pub snapshot_id: String,
    pub block_height: u64,
    pub chain: ChainId,
    pub root_hash: String,           // Merkle root
    pub transaction_count: u64,
    pub pending_transaction_count: u64,
    pub timestamp: DateTime<Utc>,
}

pub struct SnapshotProof {
    pub snapshot_id: String,
    pub transaction_id: String,
    pub merkle_path: Vec<String>,    // Merkle proof path
}
```

#### Workflow

```
1. Every N blocks (e.g., every 1000 blocks)
   - Create snapshot of bridge state
   - Calculate Merkle root
   - Publish snapshot hash
   
2. Verify transaction in snapshot
   - Use Merkle proof
   - Verify transaction inclusion
   - Confirm state consistency
   
3. Detect state divergence
   - Compare snapshots across validators
   - Halt bridge if divergence detected
   - Trigger recovery procedure
```

#### Implementation Priority: ðŸŸ¡ MEDIUM
- Excellent for long-running operations
- Enables disaster recovery
- Phase 6+ feature

---

## 3. Advanced Observability Features

### 3.1 Alerting Thresholds

**Current State**: Metrics collection only  
**Issue**: No automatic alerting on anomalies  
**Solution**: Configurable thresholds with alerts

#### Design

```rust
pub struct AlertThreshold {
    pub alert_id: String,
    pub metric_name: String,
    pub condition: AlertCondition,
    pub action: AlertAction,
    pub enabled: bool,
}

pub enum AlertCondition {
    GreaterThan(f64),           // metric > threshold
    LessThan(f64),              // metric < threshold
    RateOfChange(f64),          // increase >50% in 5min
    Consecutive(u32),           // failed N times in a row
    TimeseriesAnomaly,          // ML-based detection
}

pub enum AlertAction {
    Log,                        // Write to log
    Notification(NotificationChannel),  // Send alert
    Webhook(String),            // POST to URL
    Page(EscalationPolicy),     // Page on-call engineer
}

pub enum NotificationChannel {
    Slack,
    Email,
    Pagerduty,
}
```

#### Workflow

```
1. Configure alerts
   - Error rate > 5% â†’ Send to Slack
   - Response time p99 > 1000ms â†’ Page engineer
   - Memory usage > 80% â†’ Log warning
   
2. Metric recorded
   - Threshold check performed
   - If exceeded â†’ action triggered
   
3. Notification sent
   - Alert reaches team
   - Includes metric context
   - Links to dashboards
```

#### Implementation Priority: ðŸ”´ HIGH

```rust
pub struct TraceExport {
    pub exporter_type: TraceExportType,
    pub endpoint: String,
    pub batch_size: usize,
    pub timeout: Duration,
}

pub enum TraceExportType {
    Jaeger,      // CNCF standard
    Zipkin,      // Alternative standard
    Datadog,     // Commercial
    Custom(String),  // Custom endpoint
}

pub struct ExportedSpan {
    pub trace_id: String,
    pub span_id: String,
    pub parent_span_id: Option<String>,
    pub operation_name: String,

    pub end_time: DateTime<Utc>,
    pub tags: HashMap<String, String>,
    pub logs: Vec<SpanLog>,
}

pub struct SpanLog {
    pub timestamp: DateTime<Utc>,
    pub message: String,
    pub level: LogLevel,
}
```

#### Workflow

```
1. Span created and ended
   - Stored in local buffer
   
2. Export triggered
   - Batch 100 spans
   - Send to external system
   - Persist immediately
   
3. Query traces
   - Service dashboard queries tracer
   - Results show persisted & live traces
   - Can correlate across microservices
```

#### Implementation Priority: ðŸŸ¡ MEDIUM
- Important for debugging production issues
- Jaeger integration relatively simple
- Phase 6+ feature

---

### 3.3 Anomaly Detection (ML-based)

**Current State**: Manual threshold configuration  
**Issue**: Manual thresholds miss subtle anomalies  
**Solution**: Statistical anomaly detection

#### Design

```rust
pub struct AnomalyDetector {
    pub metric_name: String,
    pub baseline_mean: f64,
    pub baseline_stddev: f64,
    pub sensitivity: f64,  // How many Ïƒ before alert
    pub history: VecDeque<f64>,
}

pub struct AnomalyAlert {
    pub metric: String,
    pub value: f64,
    pub expected_range: (f64, f64),
    pub deviation_sigma: f64,
    pub confidence: f64,
}
```

#### Workflow

```
1. Collect baseline metrics
   - 1 week of historical data
   - Calculate mean & stddev
   
2. Detect anomalies
   - Compare new value to baseline
   - If outside 3Ïƒ â†’ anomaly detected
   - Send alert with confidence %
   
3. Continuous learning
   - Update baseline as normal operation changes
   - Ignore anomalies (don't pollute baseline)
   - Track false positive rate
```

#### Implementation Priority: ðŸŸ¢ LOW
- Nice-to-have for Phase 5
- Implement in Phase 6+ with ML library
- Requires 1+ week data collection first

---

## 4. Advanced Accessibility Features

### 4.1 Text-to-Speech Integration Hooks

**Current State**: ARIA labels only  
**Issue**: Screen reader quality depends on external screen reader  
**Solution**: Hooks for high-quality TTS

#### Design

```rust
pub struct TtsHook {
    pub element_id: String,
    pub voice_id: String,           // e.g., "google-en-us"
    pub rate: f32,                  // 0.5-2.0
    pub pitch: f32,                 // 0.5-2.0
    pub custom_text: Option<String>, // Override default
}

pub trait TtsProvider {
    async fn speak(&self, text: String, hook: &TtsHook) -> Result<AudioStream>;
}
