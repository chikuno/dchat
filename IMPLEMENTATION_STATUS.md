3. **Formal Verification**: Critical components lack formal proofs (§32)
4. **Regulatory Compliance**: Warrant API not deployed (§26)

### High-Priority Technical Debt
1. **Token-Gated Channels**: Requires marketplace integration (§4)
2. **Insurance Fund**: Economic safety net not funded (§10, §24)
3. **Phishing Detection**: User safety warnings incomplete (§22)
4. **Progressive Onboarding**: UX flow not fully implemented (§25)
5. **Plugin Marketplace**: Developer ecosystem incomplete (§23)

### Medium-Priority Improvements
1. **Compilation Warnings**: ~50 unused import/variable warnings (cleanup)
2. **Test Coverage**: 85% coverage, aim for 95%+
3. **Documentation**: API docs incomplete for some modules
4. **Performance**: Some components not yet profiled/optimized
5. **Accessibility**: VR/AR interfaces not implemented (§19)

### Low-Priority Nice-to-Haves

## Recommendations

### For Immediate Production Deployment (Testnet)
**Ready Now**: ✅ Yes, with caveats
- Core functionality (messaging, identity, networking) is production-ready
- Security is strong (encryption, ZK proofs, onion routing)
- Infrastructure is Kubernetes-ready
- Testing is comprehensive (382+ tests, 100% passing)

**Caveats**:
- Deploy as **public testnet** or **private beta**, not mainnet
- Warn users that post-quantum crypto is not yet implemented
- Economics should be play tokens (no real value)
- Game theory validation incomplete
- Formal verification pending

### For Mainnet Deployment
**Required**:
1. ✅ Complete Phase 7 (post-quantum, formal verification, governance)
2. ✅ Third-party security audit (penetration testing, crypto review)
3. ✅ Game-theoretic validation (academic peer review)
4. ✅ Bug bounty program (incentivized security research)
5. ✅ Legal review (compliance, terms of service)

**Timeline**: ~4-6 weeks for Phase 7 + 2-4 weeks for audits/testing = **6-10 weeks to mainnet**
