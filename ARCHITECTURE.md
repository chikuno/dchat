# dchat: Decentralized Chat Application Architecture

## Overview
**dchat** is a Rust-based decentralized chat application operating on a parallel blockchain chain (chat chain) alongside a currency chain. It combines end-to-end encryption, sovereign identity management, and decentralized economics to provide censorship-resistant, privacy-first communication with a smooth user experience that abstracts blockchain complexity.

## Core Design Principles
- **End-to-End Privacy**: All messages encrypted; metadata hidden via zero-knowledge proofs
- **Censorship Resistance**: Content moderation via decentralized governance, not central authority
- **Sybil Resistance**: Staking, bonding, and reputation mechanisms prevent spam and attacks
- **Wallet Invisibility**: Blockchain operations hidden behind intuitive UX
- **Local-First**: Messages stored locally with optional encrypted backup
- **Incentive Alignment**: Relay nodes, content creators, and governance participants rewarded via tokenomics

## Architectural Components

### 1. Cryptography & Key Management
**Framework**: Noise Protocol (via `snow` crate)
- **Message Encryption**: Rotating ephemeral keys per conversation for forward secrecy
- **Identity Keys**: Long-term Ed25519 public keys anchored on chat chain
- **Key Derivation**: KDF-based rotation schedule; keys rotated after N messages or T time units
- **Trust-on-First-Use (TOFU)**: Initial key pinning with optional verification via side-channel
- **Burner Identities**: Temporary throwaway keys for privacy-sensitive communications
- **Stealth Messaging**: Payloads uninspectable even by relay nodes; metadata separated from content

**Key Files**: `src/crypto/`, `src/identity/`

### 2. Identity & Reputation (Chat Chain)
**Storage**: Public-key-based sovereign identity on chat chain
- **Identity Root**: Each user controls one or more Ed25519 keypairs
- **On-Chain Registration**: Minimal identity record (pubkey, reputation score, governance participation)
- **Reputation Score**: Cryptographically provable, non-personal metrics:
  - Successful message relay count
  - Community governance participation
  - Uptime and reliability scoring
  - No direct linkage to personal data or contact graph
- **Temporary Burners**: Ephemeral identities unlinked to main identity
- **Profile Badges**: NFT-based achievements (channel founder, verified user, etc.)

**Key Files**: `src/chain/chat_chain/identity/`, `src/reputation/`

### 2.5. Decentralized Identity Management & Key Derivation
**Hierarchical Key Derivation**:
- **Root Key**: BIP-32 style master secret for primary identity (protected by secure enclave or MPC)
- **Device Keys**: Per-device derived keys enable multi-device sync without exposing root
- **Conversation Keys**: Per-peer ephemeral keys rotated per message (forward secrecy)
- **Subidentity Keys**: Secondary keys for burner identities, channels, applications
- **Key Path Standard**: `m/account/device/purpose/chain/index` follows BIP-44 hierarchy for deterministic recovery

**Multi-Device Identity Synchronization**:
- **Encrypted Device Registration**: New devices prove ownership via guardian approval or recovery key
- **Gossip-Based Sync**: Device messages encrypted under root key; peers sync metadata via encrypted channels
- **Clock Skew Tolerance**: Gossip includes timestamps; handles out-of-order delivery
- **Conflict Resolution**: Latest timestamp or majority vote on state disagreements
- **Zero-Knowledge Proof**: Sync verification without exposing device list to third parties

**Account Linking & Privacy**:
- **Linkability Control**: Users choose which identities to link on-chain (none, some, or all)
- **Privacy-Preserving Linking**: ZK proofs confirm identity ownership without revealing links
- **Unlinkable Messaging**: Burner identities completely separate; no on-chain cross-reference
- **Selective Disclosure**: Users prove reputation properties without revealing which channel/device earned them
- **Social Links**: Optional persistent social identity (Twitter, GitHub) with verified credential stamps

**Sybil Resistance Mechanisms**:
- **Device Fingerprinting**: Proof-of-humanity via device attestation (TPM/Secure Enclave signatures)
- **Guardian Bonding**: Multi-signature guardians stake tokens; slashed if they attest to fraudulent identities
- **Temporal Gating**: New identities face higher message fees for first N days; fees waive after reputation threshold
- **Rate-Limited Creation**: Maximum 1 new burner identity per device per week; social burners require social verification
- **Reputation Inheritance**: Children accounts can inherit parent reputation via cryptographic claim (one-way)
- **Economic Collateral**: Channel creation or relay operation requires minimum stake/collateral
- **Proof-of-Work Optional**: Light PoW puzzle for free account creation (spam deterrent without capital)

**Recovery & Account Takeover Prevention**:
- **Guardian Consensus**: M-of-N guardians must approve identity recovery; recovery takes T time to finalize
- **Compromised Device Detection**: Divergent key usage patterns trigger automatic key rotation alerts
- **Timelock Escrow**: Recovery keys in time-locked escrow; owner can reject recovery if they detect compromise
- **Social Recovery Backup**: Optional fallback via social identity providers (with ZK proof link)
- **Activity Confirmations**: Users confirm recent activity in recovery process (CAPTCHA alternative)

### 3. Messaging & Message Ordering
**On-Chain Guarantees**:
- **Immutable Ordering**: Blockchain-enforced message sequence numbers prevent rewriting
- **Timestamps**: Canonical chain timestamps for causality verification
- **Proof-of-Delivery**: Relay completion events recorded on-chain, triggering reward distribution
- **Message Pruning**: Consensus-driven pruning removes old messages for chain lightweight storage; local caches retained

**Protocols**:
- **Delay-Tolerant Messaging**: Messages queued for offline peers; relay nodes retry until delivery
- **DHT Routing**: libp2p/Kademlia for peer discovery; peers self-advertise availability
- **Incentivized Relays**: Relay nodes stake tokens; rewards paid on proof-of-delivery

**Key Files**: `src/messaging/`, `src/relay/`, `src/ordering/`

### 4. Channels & Access Control
**On-Chain Creation & Governance**:
- **Public Channels**: Created on-chain; anyone can join (subject to moderation)
- **Private Channels**: Encrypted membership list; access via token-gated or manual approval
- **Token-Gated Groups**: Membership requires holding/bonding specific tokens
- **Creator Economy**: Channel creators earn tipping revenue; digital goods (sticker packs) sold on marketplace
- **NFT Access**: Collectible channel badges or NFTs as access proof

**Moderation & Anti-Spam**:
- **Staking Governance**: Members stake tokens to vote on moderation actions
- **Pay-to-Send**: Microfees or bonding requirements prevent spam
- **Reputation Thresholds**: Low-reputation accounts face stricter rate limits or require verification

**Key Files**: `src/ui/`, `src/onboarding/`, `src/accessibility/`

### 11.5. Keyless UX: Secure Enclave & MPC-Based Identity
**Secure Enclave Integration (TEE)**:
- **Hardware-Backed Keys**: Private keys stored in processor secure enclave (Intel SGX, ARM TrustZone, Apple Secure Enclave)
- **Attestation**: Enclave proves to peers that keys never leave hardware via remote attestation
- **Biometric Unlock**: TouchID/FaceID triggers enclave key operations; keys never exposed to OS
- **Deterministic Signing**: Enclave signs messages with isolated private key; OS only sees signatures
- **No Key Export**: Keys permanently sealed in enclave; recovery requires multi-device guardian process
- **Fallback for Unsupported Devices**: MPC signing (below) for devices without secure enclave

**Multi-Party Computation (MPC) Signers**:
- **Threshold Signatures**: M-of-N key shards distributed across devices; M shards required to sign
- **No Single Point Failure**: Lost device doesn't compromise identity; shards on remaining devices sufficient
- **MPC Arithmetic**: Signing performed via MPC protocol without reconstructing full key
- **Guardian Integration**: Guardians can be MPC providers; recovery triggers shard redistribution
- **Offline Signing Prep**: Pre-compute signature shares in background; sign locally even if network unavailable

**User Onboarding Flow**:
1. **Account Creation**: User provides email/phone; system generates random identity
2. **Biometric Setup**: User enrolls fingerprint/face; enclave stores derived key
3. **Device Registration**: Generate QR code; scan on secondary device to register (bootstraps MPC)
4. **Guardian Appointment**: Select 3-5 trusted contacts as guardians
5. **Optional Backup**: Export encrypted recovery words (for manual guardian recovery if no devices work)
6. **Usage**: All chat operations trigger biometric prompt; enclave signs locally

**Passwordless Recovery Scenarios**:
- **Lost All Devices**: Guardians initiate M-of-N recovery; system generates new identity key, transfers reputation via ZK proof
- **One Device Compromised**: Revoke compromised device's MPC shard; redistribute to new device
- **Forgotten Biometric**: Use secondary authentication method (security questions, recovery codes)
- **Social Recovery**: Optional recovery via social identity verification (Twitter verification, email domain control)

**Security Properties**:
- **No Passwords**: No secrets users must remember or type; only biometric/enclave required
- **No Key Leakage**: Keys never leave trusted hardware; signing happens in isolation
- **Replay Attack Proof**: Each signature includes nonce/counter; same key never signs same data twice
- **Insider Protection**: Even OS can't extract keys from enclave; even attacker with root access fails

- **Sender Deniability**: Message signing uses convertible signatures; sender can deny authorship to third parties (non-repudiation optional)

**Onion Routing Protocol**:
- **Multi-Hop Encryption**: Message wrapped in N layers of encryption; each relay removes one layer
- **Layered Circuit**: User selects 3-5 random relays forming encrypted circuit; each relay only knows predecessor/successor
- **Renewal Policy**: Circuits rotate every K hops or T time to prevent traffic analysis correlation
- **Exit Node Anonymity**: Final recipient identity hidden from entry node via final layer encryption
- **Sphinx Packet Format**: Fixed-size packets prevent hop count inference
- **Return Path**: Reverse circuit for replies; symmetric anonymity for bidirectional communication

**Network-Level Privacy**:
- **Tor-Like Directory**: Directory servers advertise relay pubkeys; path selection independent per circuit

- **Mix Networks**: Optional batch-mixing of messages before relay (delays but adds plausible deniability)

**Selective Disclosure & Reputation Privacy**:
- **ZK Proofs for Attributes**: Prove reputation > threshold without revealing exact score
- **Credential Aggregation**: Combine reputation from multiple sources (relay uptime, governance participation) into single proof
- **Unlinkable Credentials**: Each proof uses fresh randomization; third parties can't correlate multiple proofs to same user
- **Revocation via Accumulator**: Compact representation of non-revoked credentials; revocation doesn't require new issuance

**Financial Privacy**:
- **Blind Token Protocol**: Users obtain tokens without revealing intended use; payments untraceable to issuer
- **CoinJoin-Style Mixing**: Messages carrying value batch-mixed with dummy transactions; observer can't link sender to receiver
- **Confidential Transactions**: Amount hidden via Pedersen commitments; observers verify valid range without seeing value
- **Zero-Knowledge Payments**: Prove sufficient balance and non-double-spend without revealing identity or history

## Security Considerations
- **Forward Secrecy**: Ephemeral Noise session keys limit exposure of past messages
- **Replay Protection**: Chain-enforced nonces and timestamps prevent replay attacks
- **Sybil Attacks**: Staking, bonding, reputation thresholds, device fingerprinting, and temporal gating raise attacker cost
- **Metadata Leakage**: ZK proofs, uninspectable payloads, onion routing, message padding, timing obfuscation, and cover traffic hide contact graphs
- **Fork Consistency**: Chain finality ensures message immutability; cryptographic dispute resolution arbitrates forks
- **Relay Censorship**: Incentive structure encourages diverse relay coverage; slashing deters censorship
- **Network Attacks**: Eclipse attacks mitigated via multi-path routing, sybil guard nodes, and ASN diversity
- **DDoS Protection**: Adaptive rate limiting, reputation-based QoS, and economic congestion pricing defend against overload
- **Account Takeover**: Multi-signature guardian recovery, timelocked reversals, biometric enclave protection, and device attestation prevent compromise
- **Abuse Misuse**: Reputation penalties for false reports deter weaponizing moderation system
- **Cross-Chain Atomicity**: Bridge validators ensure state consistency; timeouts prevent deadlock; slashing for bridge failures
- **Traffic Analysis**: Message padding, timing obfuscation, onion routing, mix networks, and dummy messages defeat timing attacks
- **Device Compromise**: Secure enclave or MPC signers ensure key isolation; compromised device cannot leak keys
- **Network Partitioning**: Partition detection, bridge activation, and causality verification maintain consistency across splits
- **BGP Hijacking**: Multi-path routing via ISP-independent peers prevents ISP-level censorship
- **Identity Linkage**: Unlinkable credentials, selective disclosure, and burner identities prevent cross-reference attacks
- **Collateral Theft**: Economic collateral safeguards via insurance pools and transparent slashing rules
- **False Reputation**: Guardian bonding ensures identity attestation quality; Sybil resistance via proof-of-humanity
